# celerytest

Featherweight FOSS OpenGL 4 Blockland clone

## Usage

Linux is required. I don't have a Windows machine to test this on.
```shell
$ ./celerytest
```

## Okay so...

### ...what do I run/make games on?

- CPU minimum: A recent Gemini Lake CPU (a CPU with AVX would be nice)
- RAM minimum: 1-2GiB (at least 4GB would be nice)
- GPU minimum: Intel UHD6xx Graphics (a video card would be nice)

### ...how do I run this?

```shell
$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake xorg-dev libglfw3-dev doxygen libluajit2-5.1-dev
```

### ...why?
I was bored
