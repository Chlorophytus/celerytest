# celerytest
Featherweight FOSS OpenGL 4 Blockland clone!

## Usage
Linux is required. I don't have a Windows machine to test this on.
```
$ ./celerytest
```

## Okay so...
### ...what do I run/make games on?
- CPU minimum: A recent Gemini Lake CPU (a CPU with AVX would be nice)
- RAM minimum: 1-2GiB (at least 4GB would be nice)
- GPU minimum: Intel UHD6xx Graphics (a video card would be nice)
### ...how do I run this?
- CMake 3.19.x required
- SDL2 (Base / TTF / Image)
- An OpenGL 4.6 runtime should be on your computer.

### ...why?
I was bored. :)
